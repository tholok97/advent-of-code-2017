## How to build

An empty `make` command will build all the days in sequence.

## How to run

`make` followed by dayX will (build and) run the executable for day X. For example: `make day4` will run day 4. The argument you're passing to make must be a filename to a .cpp file in the repository without it's extension. `make day11_old` will run the executable for `day11_old.cpp`. Alternatively you can run the executables directly from the `bin` directory (after building with make).
